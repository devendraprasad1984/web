I had used SQL queries to compare the 2 sets and get the different lines out of both the sets as well as matching records. also telling some suggestions as to where to correct differences in point based format and source system being affected by that change. These different were generally coming as sources have EBA TAXONOMY changes at their end but some mistakes were left in implementing them at our end.

This issue was fixed in WSS system in 2012 but the trades booked prior to that had to be fixed. From Potter application side, I was engaged to fix this issue and after having various discussion with technology and business, it was agreed that we will cancel and rebook all such trades but without notifying customers about this activity (as in production, notification would be sent to customers). We had to suppress all such 30000 trades into 2 downstream systems. All these activities happened directly in production with a dummy test in non prod. There were hectic coordinations with all downstream systems. But this was a success and was also acknowledge by the business for having zero impact on customers and Bank's reputation was saved",
